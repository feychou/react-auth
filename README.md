## Hello intruder!

Sample app to show how to handle auth with jwt in react context and protect routes.
This app is run with `npm i && npm start` and it's the client counterpart of this server https://github.com/feychou/scrapyard

If you want to connect to other servers, make sure to change the `API_URL` and that the routes and client/backend contract are changed accordingly :D
